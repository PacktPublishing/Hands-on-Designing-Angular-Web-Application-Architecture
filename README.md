# Hands-On Designing Angular Web Application Architecture
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Designing Angular Web Application Architecture [Video]](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Designing-Angular-Web-Application-Architecture), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
If you want to learn fast, easy, and rewarding ways to create web applications that are easy to refactor and maintain in the future with no decline in performance, then this is the right course for you.
Using the latest Angular 9 release, you will learn how to organize your application using core feature and shared modules. You'll structure container components in Angular 9 to help your application supply a presentation data flow and translate component-specific events into application state commands. You will understand state management and see how it can be implemented in Angular using NgRx, a Redux implementation for Angular 9. We'll cover how we can use Input and Output decorators in Angular 9, an easy way to exchange data between components. You'll find out how to use functions and pipes in your application, a new way to write display-value transformations that you can declare in your HTML. Finally, you will learn how to test and secure your application to make it more robust.
By the end of the course, you'll have learned to share the same functionality across an application by designing applications that are easy to maintain—now and in the future. Please note that this course assumes the following knowledge levels: Basic CSS and HTML; intermediate JavaScript and TypeScript; and prior experience with Angular Fundamentals.
